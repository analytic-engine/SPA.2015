# SPA 2015 

Presentation accompanying SPA2015 session Follow in Ada Lovelace's Footsteps.

Development
-----------

We use the excellent [generator-reveal][] to create a [reveal.js][]
presentation. =generator-reveal= in turn relies on the tools
[yeoman][], [bower][] and [grunt][]. Tools that can be installed with
[npm][] which comes with [node][].

So if you want to develop slides for this presentation on needs to
perform the following steps.

1. Install node, either from a [pre-build installer][installer] or by
   building from [source][].
2. Install the necessary tools with the following command: `[sudo] npm
   install --global yo bower grunt-cli`.
3. Next one can use the command `yo reveal:slide` to create a slide,
   or...
4. `grunt serve` to create a server that serves the presentation.

### Alternative

If you are reluctant to install all these tools you can instead
install just one: [docker][].

Once installed one can use the [dvberkel/docker-generator-reveal][]
repository to perform the same functionality.
